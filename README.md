Zeal ORM
========

Zeal is an ORM layer for Zend Framework.

## Installation

The best way to install the module is with Composer (http://getcomposer.org). Add this to your composer.json:

    "require": {
        "zealproject/zeal-orm": "dev-master"
    }

then run `composer install` to install.

You'll also need to edit your `application.config.php` to add `ZealOrm` to your module array.
